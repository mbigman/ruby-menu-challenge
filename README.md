## Ruby Menu Challenge!
```
menu = {
  :pizza => 3.50,
  :macaroni => 5.00,
  :curly_fries => 2.75,
  :donut => 1.00,
  :cuban_sandwich => 8.00,
  :hot_dog => 4.00,
  :popcorn => 7.00,
  :cotton_candy => 5.00,
  :corn => 6.00
}
```

Write a method in `menu_check.rb` that takes in two arguments: a hash with foods and prices (as above), and an amount of money. The hash should return an array of the foods that you can buy with that money. For example, if enter 3.00 for the amount of money, it should return ["curly fries", "donut"]
